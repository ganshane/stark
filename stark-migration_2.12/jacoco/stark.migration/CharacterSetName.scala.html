/**
 * The base trait for all character set names.
 */
sealed trait CharacterSetName

/**
 * The character data types should be encoded using Unicode.
 *
 * On Derby, character data types are encoded using Unicode by
 * default so specifying this does not change the encoding.
 *
 * On MySQL, this case object specifies the &quot;utf8&quot; character set.  If
 * the collation is not specified then the &quot;utf8_unicode_ci&quot; collation
 * is used.  See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/766809/ why this
 * slower collation is used instead the &quot;utf8_general_ci&quot; collation,
 * which is MySQL's default collation for the &quot;utf8&quot; character set.
 *
 * On Oracle, this specifies that NCHAR is used for CharType and
 * NVARCHAR2 for VarcharType.
 *
 * On PostgreSQL, this case object is ignored as the character set
 * encoding can only be specified when the database is created; using
 * it generates a runtime warning.
